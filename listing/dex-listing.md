# DEX Listing

For supported chains and protocols, TingTrace automatically tracks all decentralized exchanges (DEXes), whether they are officially listed or not.

To request a DEX listing, please use our Discord channel. Note that DEXes with low liquidity and trading volume may not be listed.

We evaluate DEX listings based on the following criteria:

* The DEX has substantial liquidity and daily trading volume.
* The DEXâ€™s smart contracts are open-source and have undergone auditing.
* The DEX has an active and engaged community of users.
