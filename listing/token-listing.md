# Token Listing

Tokens are automatically listed on TingTrace as soon as they are added to a liquidity pool and have at least one transaction. You can use the search bar to find any token by its name, symbol, address, or pair address.

**How do I update information about a token, such as its description and social links?**

TingTrace automatically pulls token information from external sources like CoinGecko. Once a token appears on one of these lists, all related information will be displayed on TingTrace automatically.

**Token Information Quickly Display on TingTrace**
