# Pairs Searching

Pair searching is a critical feature for traders and investors, enabling them to efficiently identify and analyze trading pairs across various decentralized exchanges and blockchains

**Cross-Chain Pair Searching:** TingTrace allows users to search for trading pairs across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and others. This cross-chain compatibility is essential for users who want to explore opportunities beyond a single network.

The platform aggregates real-time data from various DEXs, enabling users to quickly find trading pairs that match their criteria, such as liquidity, trading volume, or recent price movements.

Users can filter search results based on specific criteria like market cap, price change percentages, liquidity pools, and trading volumes. This helps traders focus on pairs that align with their trading strategies, whether theyâ€™re looking for high-volume pairs or those with specific volatility patterns

Once a pair is selected, TingTrace provides instant access to detailed analytics, including price charts, historical performance, order books, and trade history. This comprehensive view helps traders make informed decisions quickly
