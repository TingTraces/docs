**Step 1: Submit Information**

1. **Prepare Token Details**:
   * Before starting the submission process, ensure you have all the necessary details about your token ready. This typically includes:
     * **Token Name**: The name of your token (e.g., "MyToken").
     * **Token Symbol**: The shorthand symbol for your token (e.g., "MTK").
     * **Token Description**: A short description of what your token does and its purpose in the ecosystem.
     * **Website**: The official website link of your project.
     * **Whitepaper Link** (if applicable): Link to your token's whitepaper that provides a detailed explanation of the tokenomics, project goals, etc.
     * **Social Media Links**: Links to your token's official social media profiles, including Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and others.
     * **Smart Contract Address**: The blockchain address for your token (e.g., on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain).
2. **Access the TCV Tool**:

3. **Fill Out the Submission Form**:
   * Fill in the required fields with your token details. Double-check that all information is accurate, as incorrect or incomplete submissions may delay the process.

**Step 2: Receive Voting Link**

1. **Unique Voting Link**:
   * After submitting the token details, you will receive a **unique voting link**. This link is essential for promoting your token to the community and gathering votes.
2. **Share the Link**:
   * You can share this link with your community, followers, or any groups related to your token. The more exposure your link gets, the higher the chances of gathering votes. Use platforms like:
     * **Social Media**: Twitter, Telegram, Discord, etc.
     * **Community Channels**: Announce the link in your Telegram/Discord channels, or share it through email newsletters.
     * **Partnerships & Collaborations**: Work with influencers or partner projects to amplify your token's visibility.

**Step 3: Share to Community Voting**

1. **Voting Process**:
   * Anyone in the community, including your followers and the general public, can vote on your submission by clicking the provided voting link.
   * Each participant will be asked to **vote once** (or a set number of times, depending on the platform’s rules) to approve or reject the token for listing.
2. **Engage Your Community**:
   * To maximize votes, encourage your community to participate in the voting process. You can:
     * Host **AMA (Ask Me Anything)** sessions to talk about the token and ask for votes.
     * Organize **contests or rewards** where users who vote or share the link can win prizes or tokens.
     * Regularly remind your followers to vote and explain the importance of the voting process.
3. **Voting Transparency**:
   * The voting progress is usually visible to the public, meaning everyone can track how many votes your token has received in real-time. Make sure to monitor the progress and keep your community updated.

**Step 4: Automatic Display on TingTrace**

1. **Vote Threshold**:
   * Tokens will only be listed on TingTrace once they reach a **pre-determined number of votes**. This threshold ensures that only tokens with significant community support are displayed on the platform.
2. **Automated Display**:
   * Once your token submission receives enough votes, the system will **automatically list your token** on TingTrace. This includes displaying the token’s details such as:
     * Token name, symbol, and description.
     * Links to your project’s website, whitepaper, and social media.
     * Real-time price and trading data (if the token is tradable on DEXes).
3. **Post-Listing**:
   * After your token is listed, you can continue to engage with the community to maintain visibility. Regular updates, news, and active social media participation will keep your token in the spotlight.
   * Monitor the performance of your token on TingTrace, track community feedback, and ensure the listing remains active.

**Tips for Success**

* **Promote Early and Often**: The more exposure your voting link gets, the higher the likelihood of reaching the vote threshold. Don't wait until the last minute to start promoting.
* **Incentivize Voting**: Offer incentives such as exclusive content, airdrops, or token giveaways to encourage people to vote for your token.
* **Leverage Influencers and Communities**: Partner with influencers or larger community groups in your niche to drive traffic to the voting link.
* **Engage with the Community**: Respond to questions, provide updates, and stay active in the conversation to build trust and excitement around your token.

By following these steps and strategies, your token will have a clear pathway to being displayed on **TingTrace** through the TCV tool, helping it gain exposure and attract more users and investors.
