# Pair and Token Analysis

The Pair Analysis feature on TingTrace provides real-time data and insights for a specific trading pair, helping users track performance, liquidity, volume, and trading activity. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Price and Market Cap**: The current price and market cap of the token pair are displayed at the top, offering an at-a-glance view of its value and overall market size.
2. **Liquidity and 24H Volume**: Displays the current liquidity in the pool and the total 24-hour trading volume, giving insights into the availability and trading frequency of the pair.
3. **Trading Timeframes**: Users can view price changes and trading metrics over different timeframes (5 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours) to identify short- and long-term trends.
4. **Transaction Data**: Lists recent transactions in the pool with details such as:
   * **Time**: Time elapsed since each transaction occurred.
   * **Type**: Buy or sell transactions.
   * **USD Amount**: The amount of each transaction in USD.
   * **Price**: The price at which the transaction occurred.
   * **Token Amount**: The quantity of tokens bought or sold.
   * **Maker**: Address of the liquidity provider.
   * **Txn**: Transaction hash for easy verification on the blockchain.
5. **Buy and Sell Distribution**: Shows the number of buy and sell transactions and volume, giving a quick overview of market sentiment and trade direction.
6. **Maker Activity**: Provides details on the activity of liquidity providers, showing the number of unique makers who contributed to the pool, and helping to gauge pool decentralization.
7. **Pooled Tokens**: Displays the amount of each token pooled (e.g., THRUST and WETH) to support the pair's liquidity.

This information provides a comprehensive view of the trading pair's performance, helping users make informed trading decisions based on liquidity, volume, price movements, and trading patterns.
